Dextrobot :  A Simple Voice AI Bot with Web Speech API and Node.js

This is how this web app works:

  Using the Web Speech APIâ€™s SpeechRecognition interface to listen your voice from a microphone

  Send your message to API.ai (the natural language processing platform) as a text string

  Once the AI from the API.ai returns the reply text back, use the SpeechSynthesis interface to give it a synthetic voice.
